The Developer Console
=====================

The developer console provides easy, direct access to the API to aid in development or debugging your API calls.  This allows you to interact with the API without setting up an environment, where you can manually perform any of the actions available to the API.  

Note that all parameters for both GET and POST requests should be URL encoded in the query string.

The console can be found via the "Console" link under **Manage > Developer**.

.. note::

	All calls made in the console are **live** requests on your account, not examples.  Any changes you make to bookings through the console will persist outside of the console.
