# Checkfront API v3.0

**The v3.0 API and documenation is a work in progress.  Not currently available for production.**

## Changes from v2

There have been several changes in the v3.0 api that could impact some integrations.  Please review them here and update / test your project before switching to the v3 endpoint.

### Token Pair Authentication

It's now possible to bypass the OAuth2 process by using a token pair for authentication.  The token pair can be generated in the API setup page.

### New resources

- /api/3.0/ping - gets the status of the API.  
- /api/3.0/help - lists avalaible resources.
- /booking/{$ID}/invoice - fetchings the booking invoice.
- /session/clear - clear a session
- /session/reset - clear and end a session

### Deprecated

- /booking/journal - now lives under /booking


### Other changes

- The HTTP_X_ON_BEHALF is always respected when interacting with the API.  This can be passed to change the user the request is acting under.  To act on behalf of a customer / external source you can set this to "off".
- The API provider if supplied is now shown on the booking invoice footer.
- Developer console added to platform to aid in development and testing API calls.
- The booking token is now returned on booking/create
- Required fields are listed in the error message on booking/create.
- All return dates are formatted as unix timestamps.


---

The Checkfront API allows developers to expand and build on the [Checkfront Booking Platform](http://www.checkfront.com). The API makes it easy to create web, desktop & mobile applications that integrate and with your Checkfront account.

Our API is built around open, standard and secure technologies to streamline development and maintain integrity of your data.

The Checkfront API extends the following functionality:

* Query inventory availability.
* Get date based rate and pricing information.
* Create a new booking.
* Fetch invoice details.
* Update an existing booking.
* Retrieve customer information.



### Prerequisites:

This document assumes you have some knowledge of programming, and API implementations -- if not, please see our list of existing plug-ins and extensions or contact us to for in introduction to a qualified Checkfront developer in your area.

Some functionality documented here may not be available to you based on your plan, or access level of your account.  


## REST Interface

The Checkfront API uses a REST interface. This means that method calls are made over the Internet by sending standard HTTPs GET or POST requests to the Checkfront API REST server.

Nearly any computer language can be used to communicate over HTTP with the REST server including remote web sites, mobile devices and desktop applications.


## Authentication and Encryption 

You can connect to the API using a static token pair or by way of OAuth2.  A static token can be used for server to server enviorments.


Every Checkfront account operates in their own segregated environment, secure by a unique domain. In most cases, this is : https://your-company.checkfront.com. In this document this will be referred to as your Checkfront URL or your-company.checkfront.com (this may differ depending on your country).

### Token Pair ###

Unline OAuth2, token pairs are static and do not need to be refreshed.  Use this in server to server integrations where the route to the API is trusted.

All token authenticated queries to the API are required to be made over a SSL.

Token Pairs are sent over basic auth.  The API Key is used as the User, and the API Secret is used for the Password.

**Token Pair Endpoint**

    https://your-company.checkfront.com/api/3.0/

###OAuth2###

OAuth2 to provides secure and transparent authentication with the API. OAuth allows you to make your Checkfront account available to external applications without needing to provide your login and password.  Use this where the route to the endpoint can change or is unknown, for example desktop and mobile apps.

All queries to the API are required to be made over a SSL authenticated OAuth2 session. Checkfront currently supports Draft 20 of the OAuth2 spec. For those switching from OAuth1, you'll notice it's significantly easier to work with, and generally performs better.

If your app isn't going to be distributed outside of your organization, you can generate oAuth2 access keys within the app to by-pass the initial authentication routine.

Please see our SDK's or support libraries for OAuth2 in your preferred environment.

**OAuth2 Endpoints**

    https://your-company.checkfront.com/api/3.0/
	https://your-company.checkfront.com/oauth/

#### Refreshing Tokens ####

If using OAuth2 access tokens will expire in 7 days.  You need to check the status of the token and use the refresh token to refresh it.  Most OAuth2 libraries have this function built it.


### Response Formatting (JSON)

All response is formatted in JSON (JavaScript object Notation).All modern languages are able to quickly parse JSON. See: PHP: json_decode, Ruby: JSON.parse, .Net Json.NET, Javascript / jQuery: jQuery.getJSON.

### Representation

* All JSON should be UTF-8 encoded.
* Dates are returned as a unix time stamp.
* Simple dates are ISO 8601 formatted, eg: YYYY-MM-DD, HH:MM:SS and are relative to the configure timezone. 
* Some resources may return a locale formatted date.
* Booleans are either 1 (true) or 0 (false).
* Currency values are decimal formatted, e.g: 119.20.  Summary currencies will be formatted as per the system locale, eg: â‚¬119.20.



## General Housekeeping

API throttle limit: We reserve the right to tune the limitations, but they are always set high enough to allow a well-behaving interactive program to do its job.

When the rate limit is exceeded Checkfront will send an HTTP 503 status code. The number of seconds until the throttle is lifted is sent via the "Retry-After" HTTP header, as specified in RFC 3.06.


## API Request

Once authenticated, a basic request to the API will return some general information about the account you are connecting to. This header information is included in all successful calls to the API, but may be left out of examples in this document.

	GET: http://demo.checkfront.com/api/3.0/

```json
{
    "version":"3.0",
    "id":"demo.checkfront.com",
    "name":"Demo",
    "currency_id":"USD",
    "currency_symbol":"$",
    "session_id":"rmvm4jf7kh02n6dde8s9f20me1"
}
```

Error Messages

```json
{
    "error":"invalid_request",
    "error_description":"The access token was not found."
}
```

### API Webhooks

API webooks provide the ability to send an automated notification when a new booking is created or updated. You can configure API notifications in your account under Manage / Developer / Webhooks.

### Sample Code

Our SDKs (software development kit) handles most of the complex authentication (OAuth2) issues involved with consuming the Checkfront API. They also include sample code and additional documentation and up and running with the API in no time.

All of our SDKs are open source and are [available on Github](https://github.com/Checkfront).  If you have a module to contribute, please let us know.

### Terms of Use

Use of this API is strictly bound by the terms as specified in [Checkfront API Terms of Service](http://www.checkfront.com/terms/#api).

## Developer Console ##

The developer console is a new tool added to the platfrom to aid in development and testing of Checkfront integrations.  It's available under Manage / Developer / Console.  From here you can issue direct requests to the API making use of all the resources documented here.

# Checkfront API Resources

API Resources provide read and write access to Checkfront data sets. You can access Checkfront resources through standard the REST interface.

API Resources currently include: Inventory, Booking and Customer.  You can see the full list by  calling /api/3.0/help

# Inventory

The inventory resources provides access to your master inventory. This allows you to query items, determine availability and pricing for a given period. The information returned can be used to create a booking in the system.

##Categories

Items are organized by categories in the system.  A full list of available categories can be retrieved via the category resources. 

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Description:</b></td>
<td>Fetch list of categories</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/2/category/</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Methods:</b></td>
<td>GET</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[category_id]</b></td>
<td>Integer: optional category to return.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Items

You can query a list of available items based on search criteria supplied in the API call.

When no dates are passed in the API call, a full list of enabled items in the inventory.  When a date is passed, the API will return a "**rated**" response that includes pricing and availability. 

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Description:</b></td>
<td>Query items, optionally return pricing and availability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/3.0/item/</td>
</tr>
<td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/3.0/item/<b>item_id</b> (single item)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Methods:</b></td>
<td>GET</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[start_date]</b></td>
<td>Date: Start date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[end_date]</b></td>
<td>Date: End date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[start_time]</b></td>
<td>Time: Start time (used in hourly bookings).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[end_time]</b></td>
<td>Time: End time (used in hourly bookings).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[category_id]</td>
<td>Integer: Filter items by category.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[discount_code]</b></td>
<td>String: discount or voucher code to be used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[rules]</b></td>
<td>String: supply 'soft' to not trigger date based rule errors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[param]</td>
<td>Array: See - Booking parameters below.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

###Booking Paramaters

Booking parameters are defined globally in your system, and can also be configured per item.  Your parameters specify the number of items to book, for example Child and Adult.  These are completely configurable in your account under Manage / Settings / Configure.

To query specific pricing an availability you need to pass the appropriate parameters in your api call, using the ID's specified in your system configuration.

Let's say for instance you have 2 parameters configured.  Adults (id: adults), Children (id: children).  To get pricing for 2 a adults and one child you would pass: **param[adults]=2&param[children]=1** in your API call.

	GET /api/3.0/item/19start_date=3.031230&end_date=3.031230&end_date=3.031230&param[adults]=2&param[children]=1

Booking parameters have many options, and can be configured to control inventory in very specific ways.  See the Checkfront support centre for more information.

### Item details

To get detailed pricing and availability on a specific item, supply the item_id in the API call **path** along with a date filter parameters.  For example, to get item 19:

	GET /api/3.0/item/19/?start_date=3.031230&end_date=3.031230&end_date=3.031230


## SLIP

The item SLIP is a string returned when making a rated query to a specific item.  The slip contains the information needed to make a booking.  Do not attempt to reverse engineer this as the format changes.  It must be optioned vi a rated API call.

--- 

# Booking

The booking resources can be used in conduction with the item resources to create a new booking on the system.

##Sessions

When creating a booking, the details of the booking are stored in an API session.  This allows you to add multiple items to a booking, remove items and also updates the server with your intent to book the item(s) to prevent over bookings.  

To start a new session, you must have the booking SLIP returned when querying item to be booked.

Description:|Set or update a booking session.

<table>
<tr><td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/3.0/booking/session</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><b>Methods:</b></td>
<td>GET, POST</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>[session_id]</b></td>
<td>String: system generated session id.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>[slip]</b></td>
<td>String: system generated SLIP from rated Item query.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

### Create a new session
	POST /api/3.0/session?slip=3.3.030303X1-guests.1


```json
{
"version": "3.0",
"host_id": "demo.checkfront.com",
"name": "My Company",
"request": {
"obj": "booking/session",
"status": "SUCCESS",
"results": 0
},
"booking": {
"session": {
"id": "rtdv4osethqurlmqgi55mcrkm4",
"slip": {
"1": "3.3.030303X1-guests.1",
}
},
```


### Add more items to a session

Depending on your platform or SDK, the session can be passed in the form of a cookie or in the query string.  For the sake of documentation we'll pass it in the query string.  
 
	GET /api/3.0/session?slip=3.3.030303X1-guests.1&session_id=rtdv4osethqurlmqgi55mcrkm4
	
If you wish to add multiple items at once, you can supply the SLIP in the form of an array.
 

	GET /api/3.0/session?slip=[]3.3.030303X1-guests.1&slip[]=2.3.030303X1-guests.2&session_id=rtdv4osethqurlmqgi55mcrkm4


### Getting session details

You can fetch the details of the purposed booking by accessing the session resource.  The item details will be returned with any request to the booking session.

 
	GET /api/3.0/session?session_id=rtdv4osethqurlmqgi55mcrkm4

	
### Clear a session

Clearing a session removes items and slips from the session but keeps the same session id.
 
	GET /api/3.0/session/clear?session_id=rtdv4osethqurlmqgi55mcrkm4

	
### Ending a session

Clears and destroys the current session (automatically called when a booking is successfully created).

	GET /api/3.0/session/end?session_id=rtdv4osethqurlmqgi55mcrkm4


## Creating A Booking

When the required items are added to your booking session, you can create the booking.  


### Booking Fields
New bookings require customer information, and other fields as defined by your system configuration.

You can dynamically fetch the fields required to complete the booking by calling the booking/form resource along with the session, before calling booking/create.

<table>
<tr><td><b>Description:</b></td>
<td>Fetch Booking Fields.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/3.0/booking/form</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This returns an array of fields and their properties that need to be used when creating the booking.

### Booking Create

To create a booking, submit the fields from the booking/form resource along with the session id.  

<table>
<tr><td><b>Description:</b></td>
<td>Create a booking.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/3.0/booking/create</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Methods:</b></td>
<td>POST</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[session_id]</b></td><td>String: system generate session_id</td></tr>
</tr>
<tr><td><b>[fields]</b></td><td>Array: populated fields in a name value pair array from the booking/fields call.</td></tr>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If a booking is successfully created, you will be returned a completion url.  If payment is required, this will be the payment page, otherwise it will be the receipt page.

There is currently no way to complete a payment via the API.


##Check-in & Check-out

You can check-in, and checkout a booking.  By default, a note is created under the name of the account when a booking is checked in, or checked out.  VOID, and CANCELLED bookings can not be checked-in or out.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr><td><b>Description:</b></td>
<td>Check-in a booking.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/3.0/booking/<b>booking_id</b>/checkin</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Methods:</b></td>
<td>POST</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

<table>
<tr><td><b>Description:</b></td>
<td>Check-out a booking.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/3.0/booking/<b>booking_id</b>/checkout</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Methods:</b></td>
<td>POST</td></tr>
</table> 


##Bookmark
Bookmarks are made available in the Checkfront mobile apps, and are listed under bookings while logged into the platform.  You can add or remove a bookmark to a specific booking for a specific account.

This is only available if acting under and account_id.

	POST /api/3.0/booking/DZYR-250114/bookmark

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Description:</b></td>
<td>Check-out a booking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/3.0/booking/<b>booking_id</b>/checkout</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Methods:</b></td>
<td>POST</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

## Notes

Notes can be added to bookings.  By default the authenticated account will be used. 

	POST /api/3.0/booking/DZYR-250114/note

<table>
<tr><td><b>Description:</b></td>
<td>Check-out a booking.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/3.0/booking/<b>booking_id</b>/note</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Methods:</b></td><td>POST</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[body]</b></td>
<td>String: body of the note.  Upto 3000 chars.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

## Status
The status of an existing booking can be modified using the booking/status resource.

	POST /api/3.0/booking/DZYR-250114/status

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Description:</b></td>
<td>Change booking status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/3.0/booking/<b>booking_id</b>/status</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Methods:</b></td>
<td>POST</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[status_id]</b></td>
<td>String: new booking status.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

## Journal
[DEPRECATED] @todo update to /booking

The booking journal provides access to existing bookings in the system.  You can query bookings by customer id, or individually by id.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Description:</b></td>
<td>Fetch details on a booking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/3.0/booking/journal/
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/3.0/booking/journal/UJII-3.031230 (single item)
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Methods:</b></td>
<td>GET</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[customer_id]</b></td>
<td>String: customer id filter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[start_date]</b></td>
<td>Date: start date range.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[end_date]</b></td>
<td>Date: end date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[options]</b></td>
<td>Array: transactions, notes - options[transactions]=1.</td>
</tr>
</table> 

You can filter bookings based on the available arguments, or fetch a single booking by supplying the booking_id in the path of the API call.  If a single booking is requested, the response is returned in a single "booking" array.  If multiple items are requested, the response is in a "bookings" array.

### Date Range
If selecting bookings based on a date range, both the start date and end dates are required.  The dates are specific to the start and end date of items in the booking. A booking contain items in the invoice not in the time range if other items match.

---

# Customers

The customer resource provides access to customers in the system. Customers are created when a booking is made.  

There is currently no way to create customers via the API, outside of creating a booking. 

### Search customers

You can query customers based on indexed fields, including email address, name and customer id.

<table>
<tr><td><b>Description:</b></td>
<td>Query customer records</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Path:</b></td><td>/api/3.0/customer/</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Path:</b></td>
<td>/api/3.0/customer/XX5-037-755 (single record)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Methods:</b></td>
<td>GET</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[customer_email]</b></td>
<td>String: a unique customer e-mail address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[customer_id]</b></td><td>String: a unique customer id.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>[options]</b></td><td>Array: optional return formatting.  Currently: bookings=1 also includes bookings made by the customer.</td></tr>
</table>

	GET /api/3.0/customer/?customer_email=test@checkfront.com&options[bookings]=1
